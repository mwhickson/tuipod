A TUI-based Podcast Player

## Overview

In the neverending quest to find the "perfect" podcast player, I often try to create my own.

This particular endeavor follows a particularly mediocre experiment using ChatGPT to see how far I could get.

This implementation utilizes Python and Textual -- but no ChatGPT.

## TODO

- add UI
- add iTunes-based search
- add play (ideally from URL, without an intermediate full download)
